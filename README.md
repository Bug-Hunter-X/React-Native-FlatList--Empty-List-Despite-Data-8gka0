This repository demonstrates a common, yet tricky bug in React Native's FlatList component.  The bug manifests as an empty list being rendered even when data is clearly present. This is often due to inconsistencies in how data is provided to or updated within the FlatList.  The solution involves carefully managing data updates and ensuring consistency within the component's lifecycle.
