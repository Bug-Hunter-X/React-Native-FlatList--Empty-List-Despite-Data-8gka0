The solution involves using the `data` prop correctly and efficiently managing state changes. Here, we ensure that the `data` prop is always a valid array and that updates are handled using React's state management mechanisms.  Avoid directly manipulating the array, always create a new one when updating.  Also, consider using `keyExtractor` to optimize FlatList performance and ensure stable rendering of items.
